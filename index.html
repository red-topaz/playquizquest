          <h2>Why Quiz Quest?</h2>
          <p class="section-subtitle">
            Higher-level classes demand more than flashcards and generic quizzes.

            <h3>The problem</h3>
            <p>
              As students progress into higher-level classes, especially in STEM fields, they often struggle
              to find effective study tools tailored to their needs. Existing software focuses heavily on
              mastering one subject at a rudimentary level, using rigid study frameworks that don’t leave room
              for the intensive, in-depth work required in STEM majors.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="about-block">
            <h3>Our solution</h3>
            <p>
              Quiz Quest is revolutionizing this space by creating a game-based platform where students can
              upload their study material, and the game dynamically customizes itself to their content. This
              approach not only makes studying more engaging, but also ensures versatility across diverse
              subjects and learning styles.

            Our vision is to empower students to learn smarter, not harder, by combining artificial intelligence,
            gaming, and education. By transforming study sessions into interactive experiences, we aim to redefine
            how students approach learning in higher education.

            We plan to work with universities worldwide to integrate Quiz Quest into their curriculum.
            With institutional backing and verification, we can reach a larger community of students who need
            flexible, powerful, and engaging tools for advanced coursework.
